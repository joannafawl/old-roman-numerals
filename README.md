# Old Roman Numeral Converter

## About
This is an old version of a Roman numeral converter I made written in Ruby. It aims to teach the user about what a Roman numeral is, converts between Roman numerals and Arabic numbers and allows the user to practice on randomly generated numbers and take a short test on them.
